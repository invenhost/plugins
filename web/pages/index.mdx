# InvenHost

InvenHost aims to enhance and extend the functionality of core InvenTree to support commercial and enterprise use cases.

Read more about the project and goals in the docs [here](https://doc.invenhost.com/).

## Current initiatives

### Approvals
The beta is out and available for testing -> check it out [here](https://doc.invenhost.com/inventree_approval/main/)

### Infrastructure

Creating a new infrastructure for publishing and distributing InvenHost plugins - both closed and open source - requires dedicated infrastructure.

Read more about this endeavor [here](https://doc.invenhost.com/invenhost/main/services).

### Website

I have learned the hard lesson that a fancy website and marketing seems to be a requirement for a successful open source project.
A nicer looking website for InvenHost is in the works, this is a placeholder for now.
